#Java Design Pattern
###Description
This is a project with a set of design patterns implemented with Java.
Take a look at br.pedro.designpatterns to see all patterns implemented. Each pattern are inside a package with the pattern type (like structural, for instance). There are a lot of examples of those patterns on web but, still, I hope this can be useful to someone.
