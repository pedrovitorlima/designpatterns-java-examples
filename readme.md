#Java Design Pattern
###Description
This is a project with a set of design patterns implemented with Java.
Take a look at br.pedro.designpatterns to see all patterns implemented. Each pattern are inside a package with the pattern type (like structural, for instance). There are a lot of examples of those patterns on web but, still, I hope this can be useful to someone.

#### Structural Patterns
Structural patterns are about how classes are designed and composed to create bigger structures fulfill a main objective.

* [Composite](src/main/java/br/pedro/designpatterns/structural/composite/MainCompositePattern.java)
* [Decorator](src/main/java/br/pedro/designpatterns/structural/decorator/MainDecoratorPattern.java)
* [Facade](src/main/java/br/pedro/designpatterns/structural/facade/MainFacadePattern.java)
* [Flyweight](src/main/java/br/pedro/designpatterns/structural/flyweight/MainFlyweightPattern.java)

#### Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns describes patterns of classes, objects and how they communicate with each other. 	These patterns characterize complex flow that's difficult to follow at runtime.
